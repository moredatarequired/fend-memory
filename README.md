## Gameplay

Example of a classic memory game, often called "concentration". Click on a card to turn it over, then click on a second card. If the second card matches, the two cards remain face up. If they don't, both cards turn over. Remeber what each card is so that you can flip it over as soon as you've found its mate! Once all cards have been matched, you win.

The objective is to turn match all 16 cards in as few moves and as little time as possible. Your score drops from three stars to two stars after 12 moves (flipping a pair of cards counts as a single move), and then to one star after 16.

## Dependencies

The game loads the card symbols from Font Awesome 4, and will only work on browsers that support ES6.
